ebimport is a suite of utilities for converting records exported from
databases containing bird observations so they can easily be imported into
eBird.

Tools available:

   ebconvert      Converts records in CSV format into eBirds Checklist Record
                  Format.

   ebsplit        Coming Soon.

                  Splits converted files into chucks of 1MByte or less so they
                  can be uploaded to eBird.


Supported Databases:

Records have been successfully imported into eBird from the following databases

   PortugalAves   BirdLife International's database for Portugal
   Ku≈übank        BirdLife International's database for Turkey

Converting records from other Birdlife International databases hosted on
http://www.worldbirds.org will probably work.
